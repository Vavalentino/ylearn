        <p class="top-buffer-large">If you want to start a career as a mobile developer, it makes sense to start with the mobile operating system you are already familiar with. In your case this is Android. Android is great for beginners for two reasons.</p>
        <p>First, Android has more apps and more developers working on the platform than Apple’s App Store. There are many more job opportunities for Android developers. The second reason is that Android apps are developed in a language called Java.</p>
        <p>The best thing about Java is that it’s pretty much everywhere and is used for a lot of things other than Android development. 89% of private and 97% of enterprise desktop computers run Java. You can even use Java to program devices such as BluRay players or television sets. Java is the programming language with the largest job market.</p>
