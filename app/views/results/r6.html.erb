  		<p class="top-buffer-large">If you plan to start an iOS mobile app start up you should learn the programming language Swift. Apple introduced the language in 2014 as the successor of the Objective-C programming language, which has been used to develop iOS and Mac applications before. Compared to Obj-C, Swift has a very clean and easy to read syntax which makes learning much easier.</p>
      <p>Why not learn Objective-C? This makes sense if you want to start a career working on existing apps still running on Obj-C. As a start up you’re gonna start from scratch so you can choose Swift right away and you’ll be faster to reach your goals.</p>
