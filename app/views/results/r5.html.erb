    		<p class="top-buffer-large">The best language to learn to start a career in iOS development is Objective-C. Objective-C is the main language used to develop apps for iOS (iPhone, iPad) and OS X (Mac).</p>
    		<p>In 2014 Apple introduced a successor programming language to Objective-C called Swift, the vast majority of apps are however still programmed in Objective-C. Hiring managers will therefore be looking for development experience in Obj-C to help maintain their existing apps. Don’t worry; once you have a good understanding of Objective-C, learning Swift will be a piece of cake.</p>
