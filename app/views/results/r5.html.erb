    		<p class="top-buffer-large">If you want to start a career in iOS development, the best language to learn is Objective-C. Objective-C is the main language used to develop apps for iOS (iPhone, iPad) and OS X (Mac).</p>
    		<p>In 2014 Apple introduced a programming language called Swift, which is the successor to Objective-C. The vast majority of existing apps are still programmed in Objective-C. Hiring managers will be looking out for people with development experience in Obj-C to maintain their existing apps. Don’t worry; once you have a good understanding of Objective-C, learning Swift will be a piece of cake.</p>
