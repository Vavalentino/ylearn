    		<p class="top-buffer-large">We are convinced that the best way towards a career in game development is to create a game by yourself. PC and Console games are usually developed by large teams of designers and programmers covering a wide range of skills and using a variety of tools and programming languages. For smartphone games, the basic development process looks similar but there are significantly less tools and programming languages required. It therefore makes sense to get started with developing a smartphone game. Sprite Kit, a game development framework for iOS (iPhone, iPad) makes this process especially easy.</p>
    		<p>Once you have developed a complete Game with Sprite Kit, you will be familiar with the whole game development process from design to deployment which lets you then decide in which area you want to dive deeper.</p>

Over the course of two consecutive tutorials, you will design and create a Space Shooter game from scratch. The first tutorial will introduce you to game design, whereas along the second tutorial you will actually program the game.</p>
