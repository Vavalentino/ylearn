    		<p class="top-buffer-large">Weâ€™re convinced that the first step towards a career in game development is to create a game yourself. PC and console games are usually developed by large teams of designers and programmers with a wide range of skills, a variety of tools, and a range of programming languages. The basic development process for smartphone games is similar but you need far fewer tools and programming languages to get the job done. It makes sense to kick off your career by developing a smartphone game. Sprite Kit, a game development framework for iOS (iPhone, iPad) makes this process especially easy.</p>
    		<p>You will be familiar with the whole game development process, from design to deployment, by the time you complete your first game with Sprite Kit.  At this point you can decide which area you want to dive deeper into.</p>
