        <p class="top-buffer-large">If you want to create an Android app as a personal project you will need to learn a programming language called Java. The best thing about Java is that it’s pretty much everywhere and is used for a lot more than just Android development. 89% of private and 97% of enterprise desktop computers run Java. You can even use Java to program devices such as BluRay players or television sets.</p>
        <p>Your app might depend on data that is stored on a web server (e.g. user profiles, comments, posts, etc.). Java is everywhere, which means that you can use the language to develop your app and to create the web services required to feed it data.</p>
