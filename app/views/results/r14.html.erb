        <p class="top-buffer-large">If you want to create an Android app as a personal project you will need to learn a programming language called Java. The best thing about Java is that it’s pretty much everywhere and is used for a lot more than just Android development. 89% of private and 97% of enterprise desktop computers run Java. You can even use Java to program devices such as BluRay players or television sets.</p>
