      <p class="top-buffer-large">If you want to create an Android app as a personal project you will have to learn a programming language called Java. The good thing about Java is that itâ€™s almost everywhere and used in a lot of other contexts than Android development. 89% of private- and 97% of enterprise desktop computers run Java. You can even use Java to program devices such as BluRay players or television sets.</p>
      <p>Maybe your app is going to depend from data that is stored on a web server such as user profiles, comments, posts, etc. Java is everywhere, which means that you can not only use the language to develop the app but also to create the web services which are required to feed your application with timely data.</p>
