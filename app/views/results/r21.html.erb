        <p class="top-buffer-large">If you’re planning to launch a start-up, but don’t know what kind of product you want to build yet, start by learning Ruby. Chances are that, whatever kind of product you’re going to build, at least part of it will be Internet based. Ruby is great for developing web applications, which is why it’s the most popular programming language amongst start-ups. If you decide to launch a mobile app instead, you can use Ruby in conjunction with technologies like PhoneGap. You can easily create apps for iPhone, Android and Windows Phone without learning a new language.</p>
        <p>Ruby is designed for fun and productive coding. It’s mostly known for its popular web framework, Ruby on Rails. Rails is considered a breakthrough: not only has it lowered the barriers of entry to programming, it also cuts web application development times in half. If you ever get stuck, Ruby has an exceptional online community that can offer help and advice. Websites built with Ruby include Twitter, Hulu and Slideshare.</p>
