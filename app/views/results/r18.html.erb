        <p class="top-buffer-large">If you want to start a career as a mobile developer, but don’t know which platform to work on, give Android a try. For beginners there are two reasons to pick Android over iOS. First, Android has more apps and more developers working on the platform than Apple’s App Store. There are many more job opportunities for Android developers. The second reason is that Android apps are developed in a language called Java.</p>
        <p>The best thing about Java is that it’s pretty much everywhere and is used for a lot of things other than Android development. 89% of private and 97% of enterprise desktop computers run Java. You can even use Java to program devices such as BluRay players or television sets. Java is the programming language with the largest job market.</p>
