        <p>Ruby is designed for fun and productive coding and reads a lot like regular English, so it’s easy to learn. It’s well-known for its popular web framework, Ruby on Rails. Rails is considered a breakthrough: not only has it lowered the barriers of entry to programming, it also cuts web application development times in half. If you ever need help there is a very active online Ruby community where you can ask for advice. Websites built with Ruby include Twitter, Hulu and Slideshare.</p>
