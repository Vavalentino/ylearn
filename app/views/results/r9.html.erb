        <p class="top-buffer-large">If you want to become a professional web developer, you should learn a programming language called Ruby.</p>
        <p>Ruby is a modern and upcoming language, which is growing in popularity across a broad range of industries. It’s a favourite amongst start-ups, and is the number one programming language in that sector. Ruby is not typically taught in Computer Science Degrees so employers often have a hard time recruiting qualified Ruby developers. Adding Ruby to your CV will really help you to stand out on the job market.</p>
        <p>Ruby is designed for fun and productive coding. It’s mostly known for its popular web framework, Ruby on Rails. Rails is considered a breakthrough: not only has it lowered the barriers of entry to programming, it also cuts web application development times in half. If you ever get stuck, Ruby has an exceptional online community that can offer help and advice. Websites built with Ruby include Twitter, Hulu and Slideshare.</p>
