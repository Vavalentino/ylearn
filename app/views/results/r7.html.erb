        <p class="top-buffer-large">If you want to develop an iOS app as a personal project you should learn the Swift programming language. Apple introduced the language in 2014 as a successor to the Objective-C programming language, which was used to develop iOS and Mac applications beforehand. Compared to Obj-C, Swift has a very clean and easy to read syntax which makes learning much easier.</p>
        <p>Why shouldn’t you learn Objective-C? It is a good language to know if you want a career working on existing apps, many of which still run on Obj-C. You’re going to be building your app from scratch, however. Choose Swift right away and you’ll reach your goal faster.</p>
