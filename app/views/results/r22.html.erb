        <p class="top-buffer-large">If you want to create a personal web application with the option of integrating dynamic functionality (such as user logins, discussion, search etc.) you should definitely learn a programming language called Ruby.</p>
        <p>Ruby is designed for fun and productive coding and reads a lot like regular English, making it easier to learn. It’s mostly known for its popular web framework, Ruby on Rails. Rails has been a break-through in terms of lowering the barriers of entry to programming. Compared to other languages it cuts development time of web applications in half. The online Ruby community is exceptional and always happy to help out if you get stuck. Websites built with Ruby include Twitter, Hulu and Slideshare.</p>
